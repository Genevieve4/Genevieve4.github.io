      <h2 id="edu">My Education</h2>
      <p>I am in a computer science pathway at my school and have taken a couple computer science related college classes.</p>
      <h2 class="port">My Experience</h2>
      <p>I have always enjoyed being creative in my free time, but I bounced around from one thing to another so often that I never really got very good at any one thing. One thing I have devoted more time to, however, is coding on Scratch as a kid and on GDevelop now. I also made this website in HTML and CSS.</p>
      <h2 class="port">My Achievements</h2>
      <p>I have gotten perfect scores on 2 separate math AIR tests, a 1470 on the PSAT/NMSQT, and a 35 on the ACT my first try. I was also recognized by College Board as part of the National Rural and Small Town Recognition Program.</p>
      <h2 class="port">Great Depression Food Rationing</h2>
      <p>I have finished one game for a final project in my American history class my softmore year of high school. In the game you take care of your family during the Great Depression with limited income. <a href="https://gd.games/rainbowpoodle6/great-depression-food-ration"> Play my Great Depression food rationing game on gd.games.</a></p>
