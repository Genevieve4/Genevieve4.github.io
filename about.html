          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <p class=left>I grew up with restricted time to play video games or watch television, but I had unlimited time to mess around on Scratch, which is where my passion for coding began. I often struggled for ideas, but when I had one, I made it happen. I enjoyed the challenge of every bug fix.</p>
          <h2>My Traits</h2>
         <p class=left>I am positive, hard working, smart, creative, and most of all, I love solving problems. I often play escape room style games and get bored when my brain is not challenged for too long, like if I am watching television or playing a game that is too easy. I also love to talk, and many people close to me enjoy having conversations with me.</p>

          <h2  class=right>My Interests</h2>
          <p class=right>I have always loved video games, but not always in a traditional sense. Some of my favorite games are Minecraft, The Sims 4, Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and Cube Escape Collection. I actively avoid games based solely around combat, as it either bores me or stresses me out, depending on how itâ€™s implemented.</p>
          <h2  class=right>My Pets</h2>
          <p class=right>I have 3 dogs, 2 cats, and 2 parakeets. In the order we got them, there's Whisper the black cat, Daisy the German Shepherd mix, Oreo the tuxedo cat, Chaplin the Pitbull mix, and Penny the Cairn Terrier.</p>
